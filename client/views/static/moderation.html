      <p>The Student Government (SG) created the Pawprints platform on the Student Government website to foster a focused and civil conversation about how the SG should address a range of issues. This moderation policy ensures that Pawprints can fulfill that purpose and advances important interests. It promotes a focused and productive discussion by limiting petitions to those addressing SG action or policy on the topics included in Pawprints. It encourages the participation of all RIT individuals representing a wide range of viewpoints, ages, and backgrounds by promoting an atmosphere of civility.</p>
      <p>To advance these compelling interests, the Terms of Participation for Pawprints place some reasonable restrictions on the use of the Pawprints platform:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Petitions must fall within the scope of Pawprints—i.e., seeking SG actions or policies on the topics included in the platform. Petitions that fall outside of this scope violate the Terms of Participation and will be removed in accordance with this Moderation Policy.</li>
        <li><p>Additionally, petitions containing the following material violate the Terms of Participation and will be removed in accordance with this Moderation Policy:</p>
          <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
            <li>Threats of unlawful violence or harm to any individual or group</li>
            <li>Obscene, vulgar, or lewd material</li>
            <li>Defamatory or fraudulent statements</li>
            <li>Terms commonly understood to constitute profanity or abusive or degrading slurs or epithets</li>
            <li>Information that invades an individual’s privacy</li>
            <li>Information that if published would violate criminal law or give rise to civil liability</li>
            <li>Information against U.A.E.’s legal policies or that is against the region’s policies for example, vulgar dress-code, alcohol, or use of substance.</li>
            <li>Information not related to RIT Dubai</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Student Government will periodically review petitions to determine whether they are consistent with the Terms of Participation. As part of Pawprints, users will have the ability to “flag” petitions that they believe violate the Terms of Participation. The Student Government may rely on these flags to identify petitions that should be reviewed for consistency with the Terms of Participation. Petitions will not be selected for review or removal on the basis of the viewpoint they advance.</p>
      <p>If a review determines that a petition violates the Terms of Participation, the petition will be removed from Pawprints. The user who submitted the petition will be notified and have the opportunity to request reconsideration of the determination. The only consequence of submitting a petition that violates the Terms of Participation will be the removal of the petition from Pawprints. The user may create additional petitions that advance their view but are consistent with the Terms of Participation; they may also utilize the alternative official channels described above.</p>
      <h3>Terms of Participation</h3>
      <p>We invite you to participate in the Pawprints platform. You may use this platform on the Pawprints website to create and sign petitions that call for the Student Government (SG) to take action on a range of issues. For each topic included in Pawprints, you can petition the SG to address a problem, support or oppose a proposal, or otherwise change or continue actions. As explained below, if a petition meets the signature goal within the designated period, the SG will aim to respond to that petition within 2 days wherever possible.</p>
      <p>By participating in Pawprints, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Participation and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Paw prints expands the options for contacting the SG and does not displace current official methods of communication, such as mailing or emailing the SG.</p>
      <p>In order to create or sign an existing Pawprints petition, you must have an existing RIT ID.You may not sign the same petition more than once. Creating Pawprints petitions must be done by individuals interacting directly with pawprints.rit.edu/dubai and not through a third-party website or service. Users signing existing petitions may do so directly on pawprintsdubai.rit.edu/dubai.</p>
      <p>The SG may suspend user accounts from using Pawprints, remove associated signatures and remove petitions created or signed by users that it has reasonable belief do not satisfy the above rules. Outside of these circumstances, the SG will not entertain requests to modify the language of a submitted petition or to remove a signature from it.</p>
      <p>You agree that the SG can send you email updates related to Pawprints. This includes, but is not limited to, system-generated emails used to verify your email address, updates on the progress of a petition you created or signed, and official responses to that petition. In addition to emails related to SG, you can also choose to receive additional email updates about other topics. You can always unsubscribe from future SG email by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any SG email.</p>
      <p>You agree to only create petitions consistent with the limited purpose of the Pawprints platform, which is to allow individuals to petition the Administration to take action on a range of issues — to address a problem, support or oppose a proposal, or otherwise change or continue federal government policy or actions. To focus discussion, the platform is limited to a discrete set of topics, which may be adjusted over time.</p>
      <p>You agree not to create petitions that fall outside this limited purpose—for example, petitions that do not address the current or potential actions or policies of the SG, or petitions that address a topic not included in SG at the time the petition was created.</p>
      <p>You also agree not to post threats of unlawful violence or harm to any individual or group; obscene, vulgar, or lewd material; defamatory or fraudulent statements; terms commonly understood to constitute profanity or abusive or degrading slurs or epithets; information invading an individual’s privacy; and information that if published would violate criminal law or give rise to civil liability. These categories of material are inconsistent with the limited purpose of Pawprints and the larger purpose and function of the SG’s website.</p>
      <p>Petitions that the moderator determines violate these Terms of Participation will be removed consistent with the Pawprints Moderation Policy; petitioners will be able to seek reconsideration of the removal. As part of the moderation system for Pawprints, participants will be able to flag a petition if they believe it violates these Terms. You agree to flag only those petitions you believe violate these Terms. You agree not to flag petitions for any other reasons, including your disagreement with the viewpoint reflected in a petition.</p>
      <p>The SG will respond to petitions submitted through Pawprints that comply with these Terms of Participation and reach the second signature threshold listed below. Petitions that do not meet the required signature thresholds will be removed from the site after the time limit has expired. The SG may elect to respond to petitions at any time, including those that have not crossed the first or second threshold.</p>
      <p>To avoid the appearance of improper influence, the SG may decline to address certain procurement, law enforcement, adjudicatory, or similar matters that do not fall within its jurisdiction. Where possible, we will notify signers of petitions whose content falls into these areas, in instances in which we don't feel we will be able to respond meaningfully.</p>
      <p>Participation in the Pawprints platform does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against RIT, its departments, agencies, or entities, its staff, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
      <p>The SG reserves the right to change the time limits and signature thresholds and apply them to petitions created after the change has been published to this “Current thresholds” section:</p>
      <p>AS OF SEPTEMBER 15, 2015: <br /> To cross the required threshold and be searchable within pawprints.rit.edu/dubai, a petition must reach 40 signatures within 30 days.</p>
