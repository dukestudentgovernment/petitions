          The Student Government has created Pawprints to be a platform on the Student Government website where individuals can create and sign petitions that call for action by the SG on a range of issues our students are facing. For each topic included in Pawprints, users can petition the Administration to address a problem, support or oppose a proposal, or otherwise change or continue SG policies or actions. 
      </p>
      <p>Once a petition is created by a user, it will be automatically submitted for moderation, to ensure it complies with the Pawprints Moderation Policy. Once this is approved, he or she will receive a direct link to that petition that may be shared in order to gain signatures for the petition. If the petition meets the pre-set signature threshold within a designated time period, the petition will become visible to individuals browsing or searching the Student Government website. If enough users sign the petition to reach a pre-set signature threshold within that time period, the Student Government commits to respond to the petition in a timely fashion. The Student Government may also elect to respond to any petition before it reaches the first or second threshold. Once the Student Government responds to a petition, it is closed to additional signatures.
          </p>
      <p>
          To participate in Pawprints, an individual must agree to Terms of Participation that describe the scope of the Pawprints platform and set certain reasonable restrictions on its use. Pawprints expands the options for contacting the Student Government and does not displace current official methods of communication, such as mailing or emailing the Student Government.
      </p>
      <p>
          The Student Government (SG) created the Pawprints platform on the Student Government website to foster a focused and civil conversation about how the SG should address a range of issues. This moderation policy ensures that Pawprints can fulfill that purpose and advances important interests. It promotes a focused and productive discussion by limiting petitions to those addressing SG action or policy on the topics included in Pawprints. It encourages the participation of all RIT individuals representing a wide range of viewpoints, ages, and backgrounds by promoting an atmosphere of civility.
      </p>
      <p>To advance these compelling interests, the Terms of Participation for Pawprints place some reasonable restrictions on the use of the Pawprints platform:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Petitions must fall within the scope of Pawprints—i.e., seeking SG actions or policies on the topics included in the platform. Petitions that fall outside of this scope violate the Terms of Participation and will be removed in accordance with this Moderation Policy.</li>
          <li>
              <p>Additionally, petitions containing the following material violate the Terms of Participation and will be removed in accordance with this Moderation Policy:</p>
              <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
                  <li>Threats of unlawful violence or harm to any individual or group</li>
                  <li>Obscene, vulgar, or lewd material</li>
                  <li>Defamatory or fraudulent statements</li>
                  <li>Terms commonly understood to constitute profanity or abusive or degrading slurs or epithets</li>
                  <li>Information that invades an individual's privacy</li>
                  <li>Information that if published would violate criminal law or give rise to civil liability</li>
                  <li>Information not related to RIT Croatia</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Student Government will periodically review petitions to determine whether they are consistent with the Terms of Participation. As part of Pawprints, users will have the ability to “flag” petitions that they believe violate the Terms of Participation. The Student Government may rely on these flags to identify petitions that should be reviewed for consistency with the Terms of Participation. Petitions will not be selected for review or removal on the basis of the viewpoint they advance.</p>
      <p>If a review determines that a petition violates the Terms of Participation, the petition will be removed from Pawprints. The user who submitted the petition will be notified and have the opportunity to request reconsideration of the determination. The only consequence of submitting a petition that violates the Terms of Participation will be the removal of the petition from Pawprints. The user may create additional petitions that advance their view but are consistent with the Terms of Participation; they may also utilize the alternative official channels described above.</p>
      <p>We invite you to participate in the Pawprints platform. You may use this platform on the Pawprints website to create and sign petitions that call for the Student Government (SG) to take action on a range of issues. For each topic included in Pawprints, you can petition the SG to address a problem, support or oppose a proposal, or otherwise change or continue actions. As explained below, if a petition meets the signature goal within the designated period, the SG will aim to respond to that petition within 2 days wherever possible.</p>
      <p><b>By participating in Pawprints, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Participation and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.</b></p>
      <p>In order to create or sign an existing Pawprints petition, you must have an existing RIT ID.You may not sign the same petition more than once. Creating Pawprints petitions must be done by individuals interacting directly with pawprints.rit.edu/zagreb and not through a third-party website or service.</p>
<p>The SG may suspend user accounts from using Pawprints, remove associated signatures and remove petitions created or signed by users that it has reasonable belief do not satisfy the above rules. Outside of these circumstances, the SG will not entertain requests to modify the language of a submitted petition or to remove a signature from it.</p>
<p>You agree that the SG can send you email updates related to Pawprints. This includes, but is not limited to, system-generated emails used to verify your email address, updates on the progress of a petition you created or signed, and official responses to that petition. In addition to emails related to SG, you can also choose to receive additional email updates about other topics. You can always unsubscribe from future SG email by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any SG email.</p>
<p>To avoid the appearance of improper influence, the SG may decline to address certain procurement, law enforcement, adjudicatory, or similar matters that do not fall within its jurisdiction. Where possible, we will notify signers of petitions whose content falls into these areas, in instances in which we don't feel we will be able to respond meaningfully.</p>
<p>Participation in the Pawprints platform does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against RIT, its departments, agencies, or entities, its staff, employees, or agents, or any other person.The SG reserves the right to change the time limits and signature thresholds and apply them to petitions created after the change has been published to this “Current thresholds” section.</p>
