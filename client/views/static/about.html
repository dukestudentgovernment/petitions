          <p>Student Government President Ashley Carrington and Vice President Tyler Pierce (2014-2015) sought to improve engagement of RIT Students through a Petition site. The site creates a place for the RIT community to converse on important issues.</p>
          <p>To remain transparent, this site is an open source project available on <a href="https://github.com/ritstudentgovernment/petitions">GitHub</a>. Additionally, API Access gives the community a convenient way to access the information available through this service.</p>
